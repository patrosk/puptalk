# Puptalk

Puptalk is a motivational quote generator with cute puppies.

The quotes are fetched from the API [quotable](https://github.com/lukePeavey/quotable).

The images are downloaded from [unsplash](https://www.unsplash.com) and the icon from [flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com). I do not own these.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
